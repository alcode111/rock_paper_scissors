ROCK - PAPER - SCISSORS
This project is about implementing some javascript principles to create the game of rock-paper-scissors. There will be two phases :

- In the first one, the game will played from the browser's console.
- In the second step however, the game will be played from a webpage.

This last step will showcase what we have learned about DOM Manipulation.
